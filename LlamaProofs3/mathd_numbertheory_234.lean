-- Formal statement 
-- 1. Start by assuming that $a$ is the tens digit and $b$ is the units digit.
-- 2. Use the fact that $a$ is the tens digit to write $a$ as $a$.
-- 3. Use the fact that $b$ is the units digit to write $b$ as $b$.
-- 4. Substitute $a$ and $b$ into the equation $$(10a+b)^3=912673$$
-- 5. Expand the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial theorem.
-- 6. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
-- 7. Use the fact that $a$ is the tens digit to write $a$ as $a$.
-- 8. Use the fact that $b$ is the units digit to write $b$ as $b$.
-- 9. Substitute $a$ and $b$ into the equation $$(10a+b)^3=912673$$
-- 10. Expand the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial theorem.
-- 11. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
-- 12. Use the fact that $a$ is the tens digit to write $a$ as $a$.
-- 13. Use the fact that $b$ is the units digit to write $b$ as $b$.
-- 14. Substitute $a$ and $b$ into the equation $$(10a+b)^3=912673$$
-- 15. Expand the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial theorem.
-- 16. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
-- 17. Use the fact that $a$ is the tens digit to write $a$ as $a$.
-- 18. Use the fact that $b$ is the units digit to write $b$ as $b$.
-- 19. Substitute $a$ and $b$ into the equation $$(10a+b)^3=912673$$
-- 20. Expand the left-hand side of the equation using the binomial theorem.
-- 21. Simplify the equation by combining like terms.
-- 22. Use the fact that $a$ is the tens digit to write $a$ as $a$.
