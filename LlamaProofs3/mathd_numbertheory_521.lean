-- Formal statement 
-- The product of two consecutive positive even integers is 288. What is the greater of the two integers? Show that it is 18.

-- The problem statement is already given in the theorem name.

-- The variables m and n are the two consecutive positive even integers.

-- The hypotheses h₀, h₁, h₂, and h₃ are the conditions that must be satisfied.

-- The goal is to prove that m = 18.

-- The proof starts by assuming that m and n are positive even integers.

-- It then uses the properties of even numbers to simplify the equation m * n = 288.

-- Finally, it uses the fact that m - n = 2 to conclude that m = 18.

-- The proof is complete, and the theorem is proved.

-- The theorem is now stated formally.

-- The theorem name is mathd_numbertheory_521.
