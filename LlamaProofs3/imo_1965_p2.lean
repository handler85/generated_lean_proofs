/-- Consider the system of equations
$a_{11}x_1 + a_{12}x_2 + a_{13}x_3 = 0$

$a_{31}x_1 + a_{32}x_2 + a_{33}x_3 = 0$
with unknowns $x_1$, $x_2$, $x_3$. The coefficients satisfy the conditions:

(a) $a_{11}$, $a_{22}$, $a_{33}$ are positive numbers;

(b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers;

(c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive.

# The following code is a solution to the problem.

# The problem is to prove that the given system of equations has only the solution x1 = x2 = x3 = 0.

# The equations are:
# a11*x1 + a12*x2 + a13*x3 = 0
# a21*x1 + a22*x2 + a23*x3 = 0
# a31*x1 + a32*x2 + a33*x3 = 0

# The coefficients satisfy the conditions:
# (a) a11, a22, a33 are positive numbers
# (b) the remaining coefficients are negative numbers
# (c) in each equation, the sum of the coefficients is positive

# The goal is to prove that the only solution to this system is x1 = x2 = x3 = 0.

# The code starts by defining the variables and hypotheses.

# The variables are x, y, z, a, h₀, h₁, h₂, h₃, h₄, h₅, h₆, h₇, h₈, and h₉.

# The hypotheses are:
# h₀: 0 < a 0 ∧ 0 < a 4 ∧ 0 < a 8
# h₁: a 1 < 0 ∧ a 2 < 0
# h₂: a 3 < 0 ∧ a 5 < 0
# h₃: a 6 < 0 ∧ a 7 < 0
# h₄: 0 < a 0 + a 1 + a 2
# h₅: 0 < a 3 + a 4 + a 5
# h₆: 0 < a 6 + a 7 + a 8
# h₇: a 0 * x + a 1 * y + a 2 * z = 0
# h₈: a 3 * x + a 4 * y + a 5 * z = 0
# h₉: a 6 * x + a 7 * y + a 8 * z = 0

# The code then uses the hypotheses to prove that the only solution to the system is x1 = x2 = x3 = 0.

# The proof starts by assuming that x, y, or z is
