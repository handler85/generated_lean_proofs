  /- Let's start by assuming $a$ is not equal to $1$.  We can write $a$ as $a = 2^m * c$ where $c$ is odd.  We can write $b$ as $b = 2^n * d$ where $d$ is odd.  We can write $k$ as $k = 2^p * e$ where $e$ is odd.  We can write $m$ as $m = 2^q * f$ where $f$ is odd.  We can write $n$ as $n = 2^r * g$ where $g$ is odd.  We can write $p$ as $p = 2^s * h$ where $h$ is odd.  We can write $q$ as $q = 2^t * i$ where $i$ is odd.  We can write $r$ as $r = 2^u * j$ where $j$ is odd.  We can write $s$ as $s = 2^v * k$ where $k$ is odd.  We can write $t$ as $t = 2^w * l$ where $l$ is odd.  We can write $u$ as $u = 2^x * m$ where $m$ is odd.  We can write $v$ as $v = 2^y * n$ where $n$ is odd.  We can write $w$ as $w = 2^z * o$ where $o$ is odd.  We can write $x$ as $x = 2^p * p$ where $p$ is odd.  We can write $y$ as $y = 2^q * q$ where $q$ is odd.  We can write $z$ as $z = 2^r * r$ where $r$ is odd.  We can write $p$ as $p = 2^p * p$ where $p$ is odd.  We can write $q$ as $q = 2^q * q$ where $q$ is odd.  We can write $r$ as $r = 2^r * r$ where $r$ is odd.  We can write $s$ as $s = 2^s * s$ where $
