# Formal statement 
# Find $y$: $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. Show that it is 10.
# 
# ## Solution
# 
# We start by assuming that $y$ satisfies $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. 
# 
# First, we note that $\sqrt{19+3y} \ge 0$ since $19+3y \ge 0$ (by assumption). 
# 
# Now, we square both sides of the equation to get 
# 
# $$(\sqrt{19+3y})^2 = 7^2$$ 
# 
# $$19+3y = 49$$ 
# 
# $$3y = 30$$ 
# 
# $$y = 10$$ 
# 
# So, we have shown that $y = 10$ satisfies $\sqrt{19+3y} = 7$. 
# 
# ## Formal statement 
# 
# We can formalize this proof using Lean.
