# Formal statement 
# 
# The goal is to solve the congruence $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$, 
# which means we want to find the smallest non-negative integer $n$ 
# such that $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# We start by rewriting the congruence as $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$ 
# which is equivalent to $2n - 15 \equiv 0 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Now we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm to find 
# the coefficients $a$ and $b$ such that $2a + 47b = 1$. 
# 
# Once we have these coefficients, we can write 
# $n \equiv 15 \cdot a \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Now we can substitute $a$ with $-b$ to get 
# $n \equiv 15 \cdot (-b) \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Since $n$ is an integer, we can multiply both sides 
# by $-1$ to get 
# $n \equiv -15 \cdot b \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Now we can substitute $b$ with $1$ to get 
# $n \equiv -15 \cdot 1 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Now we can simplify the right-hand side to get 
# $n \equiv -15 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Now we can rewrite the congruence as $n \equiv 47 - 15 \pmod{47}$ 
# which is equivalent to $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Therefore, the smallest non-negative integer $n$ 
# such that $2n \equiv 15 \pmod{47}$ is $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Hence, we can conclude that $n \equiv 31 \pmod{47}$. 
# 
# Now we can use the extended Euclidean algorithm 
# to find the coefficients $a$ and $b$ such that 
# $2a + 47b = 1$. 
# 
# Once we have these coefficients, we can write 
# $n \equiv 15 \cdot a \p
