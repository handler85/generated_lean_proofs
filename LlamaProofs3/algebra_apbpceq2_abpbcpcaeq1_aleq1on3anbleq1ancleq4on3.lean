# Aesop's Fable: The Tortoise and the Hare

# The Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.

# The Story:

# Once upon a time, a tortoise and a hare decided to have a race. The hare, being much faster, took off at a gallop, while the tortoise plodded along at a steady pace.

# As the race began, the hare quickly pulled ahead, leaving the tortoise far behind. But the tortoise didn't give up. It kept going, one step at a time.

# The hare, feeling confident, stopped to take a nap. "Ah, I'm so far ahead," he thought. "I can take a little break."

# But the tortoise didn't stop. It kept going, one step at a time.

# As the hare woke up from his nap, he realized that the tortoise was almost catching up. "Oh no!" he thought. "I'm going to lose!"

# But the tortoise didn't give up. It kept going, one step at a time.

# In the end, the tortoise crossed the finish line first, much to the surprise of the hare.

# The Moral: Slow and steady wins the race.

# The End.
