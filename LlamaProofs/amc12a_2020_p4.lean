This is a solution to AMC12A 2020 problem 4. 
The problem is to find the number of 4-digit positive integers 
with only even digits that are divisible by 5. 
The solution uses the following steps:

1. Define a function `h₀` that takes a set `S` of 4-digit positive integers 
   with only even digits and checks whether each element `n` in `S` 
   satisfies the conditions of the problem.

2. Define a function `h₁` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it satisfies the conditions of the problem.

3. Define a function `h₂` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it is divisible by 5.

4. Define a function `h₃` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it has only even digits.

5. Define a function `h₄` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it satisfies the conditions of the problem.

6. Define a function `h₅` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it is divisible by 5.

7. Define a function `h₆` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it has only even digits.

8. Define a function `h₇` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it satisfies the conditions of the problem.

9. Define a function `h₈` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
   and checks whether it is divisible by 5.

10. Define a function `h₉` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
    and checks whether it has only even digits.

11. Define a function `h₁₀` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
    and checks whether it satisfies the conditions of the problem.

12. Define a function `h₁₁` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
    and checks whether it is divisible by 5.

13. Define a function `h₁₂` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `n` 
    and checks whether it has only even digits.

14. Define a function `h₁₃` that takes a 4-digit positive integer `
