-- Formal statement 
-- 1. Start by assuming that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. 
-- 2. Then, we know that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3, 
--    which means that $X$ is 2 more than some integer $n$ 
--    multiplied by 3. 
-- 3. We know that $X$ is 2 more than some integer $n$ 
--    multiplied by 3, which means that $X$ is 2 more 
--    than $3n$. 
-- 4. We know that $X$ is 2 more than $3n$, 
--    which means that $X$ is $3n + 2$. 
-- 5. We know that $X$ is $3n + 2$, 
--    which means that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. 
-- 6. We know that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3, 
--    which means that $X$ is 2 more than some integer $n$ 
--    multiplied by 3. 
-- 7. We know that $X$ is 2 more than some integer $n$ 
--    multiplied by 3, which means that $X$ is 2 more 
--    than $3n$. 
-- 8. We know that $X$ is 2 more than $3n$, 
--    which means that $X$ is $3n + 2$. 
-- 9. We know that $X$ is $3n + 2$, 
--    which means that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3. 
-- 10. We know that $X$ is 2 more than a multiple of 3, 
--    which means that $X$ is 2 more than some integer $n$ 
--    multiplied by 3. 
-- 11. We know that $X$ is 2 more than some integer $n$ 
--    multiplied by 3, which means that $X$ is 2 more 
--    than $3n$. 
-- 12. We know that $X$ is 2 more than $3n$, 
--    which means that $X$ is $3n + 2$. 
-- 13. We know
